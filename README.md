# no-dice-ware
A python3 script to generate secure and memorable passphrases with Diceware for those too lazy to use actual dice
Supported languages are English and German, but the script can easily be adapted.

Be aware that not using real dice, but the OS secure random number generator may defeat the purpose of creating real random numbers depending on the environment in which you run this script!

## Run the script
```sh
python generate.py
```
